    "##### Problem:\n",
    "Target was in need of increasing their revenue with the use of attracting pregnant womens to buy supplies. Pole, the new hire of the guest marketing division of the target, was asked by marketing team to find a way to know if they could find out if a guest is going through pregnancy. The problem, marketing team at Target had that they knew the shopping habbits change when a child comes into a family. So, they wanted to lure in  the Guest, or so called new customers, to buy baby products at Target. But, doing so, the family will not only buy baby products but all the household supplies gradually, thus increasing the revenue. <br>\n",
    "So, they wanted to target such womens who are in their second trimester. So, that they'd buy products from Target and gradually turn into loyal customer. So, the crucial problem was to find out if a guest is pregnant or not.\n",
    "How does one finds out? One can use statistical methods to find out if a women is pregnant or not. Thus predicting that the women is a pregnant one and is in her second trimester was the key to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Solution:\n",
    "The target variable - pregnant women, can be found out using the training data. Where IsPregnant variable can be checked with other shopping habbits. What items are purchased by child bearing womens, what time they shop, what day is preferred. So, finding a model to fit this data perfectly, we'll require to make use of most of the techniques to find out the relation between the data and results. As it turned out Target knew that the Guest is a pregnant women or not, when she bought zinc and magnesium supplies in some quantities. So, to check if the model formed works. We can target some guests who fit into the model. And if we get positive results, that the women is indeed pregnant or not. We can then see that the given technique would be perfect for the given problem. And thus overfitting can be avoided.\n"
